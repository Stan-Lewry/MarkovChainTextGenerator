# Markov Chain Text Generator

This is an application that utilizes a Markov Chain to generate a psuedo-random string of words based on a given corpus.
A Markov Chain is an example of a Markov Process, which is defined as a process that satisfies the Markov Property.
The Markov Property refers to the memoryless property of a process, meaning that each transition is only dependant on the current state and does not require information from previous states.
